# Mappable

App that allows friends to collaborate and share personalized maps of cities. 

## What and Why 

Mappable is an app that allows for collaborative and customizable maps. If you and some friends are having trouble deciding where to go out for food or drinks Mappable makes it easy. Go onto the app and see all your friends favorite establishments and the memories and the reviews that they have left at each place. It digitizes word of mouth reccomendations. 

## Who

For anyone who enjoys trying out new locations and loves to spend time with their friends. Especially for people who live in cities because of the abundance of choice there. 

## How

Each user can save location and organize them into different groups, think dinner spots, bars, brunch places etc. When you are on the app you can choose to view just your saved locations, a certain friends, or all of your friends locations at the same time. Maps and pins are customizable with different color options and pin icons. Each time you save a location you are given the option to add photos, tag friends who you went with and leave a review. 

## Scope 

To begin with Mappable can be implemented just in NYC to make the scope smaller. With up to 10 developers it is resonable to create Mappable within the course of a semester.
